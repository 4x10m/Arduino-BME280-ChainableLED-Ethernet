# Arduino-BME280-ChainableLED-Ethernet
This project has been realized at school. It is an interface for arduino with three modules.

In this project, we use an arduino board with two shields.
The first shield has many i2c and digital wire and the second provide ethernet capabilities.
On the first shield is connected a BME280 sensor which has a temperature, pressure and huminity sensor.
We have also a RGB LED which is chainable.

The goal is to provide a web interace throught the ethernet access in order to control the led color and to retrieve sensor informations.
